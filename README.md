# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Hyperledger Fabric

## Overview

Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source enterprise-grade permissioned distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform, designed for use in enterprise contexts, that delivers some key differentiating capabilities over other popular distributed ledger or blockchain platforms.

One key point of differentiation is that Hyperledger was established under the Linux Foundation, which itself has a long and very successful history of nurturing open-source projects under **open governance** that grow strong sustainable communities and thriving ecosystems. Hyperledger is governed by a diverse technical steering committee, and the Hyperledger Fabric project by a diverse set of maintainers from multiple organizations. It has a development community that has grown to over 35 organizations and nearly 200 developers since its earliest commits.

Fabric has a highly **modular** and **configurable** architecture, enabling innovation, versatility and optimization for a broad range of industry use cases including banking, finance, insurance, healthcare, human resources, supply chain and even digital music delivery.

Fabric is the first distributed ledger platform to support **smart contracts authored in general-purpose programming languages** such as Java, Go and Node.js, rather than constrained domain-specific languages (DSL). This means that most enterprises already have the skill set needed to develop smart contracts, and no additional training to learn a new language or DSL is needed.

The Fabric platform is also **permissioned**, meaning that, unlike with a public permissionless network, the participants are known to each other, rather than anonymous and therefore fully untrusted. This means that while the participants may not _fully_ trust one another (they may, for example, be competitors in the same industry), a network can be operated under a governance model that is built off of what trust _does_ exist between participants, such as a legal agreement or framework for handling disputes.
