Compatibility Between Client/Server Versions\
Compatibility between NoMachine v.8 and client/server v. 7/v. 6 is fully preserved. However, it's strongly suggested to upgrade both client and server side to the last available version to benefit from the new features.

#### 1.2. Windows Installation <a href="#head-0" id="head-0"></a>

**Step 3**: Click Next to proceed and please wait while Setup completes the installation â€¦ You can then select where to install NoMachine or let the default location as it is. What's important to remember is that all successive updates will take place there. To change the place of installation you will have to uninstall the software and proceed with a fresh install.

**Reboot is mandatory** to complete the installation.

**Step 4**: Accept to reboot your machine to complete the installation and exit the Installer.



## Connect to NoMachine <a href="#connect-to-nomachine" id="connect-to-nomachine"></a>

#### Connect from Your Computer to a Computer with NoMachine Installed <a href="#head-70" id="head-70"></a>

**Pre-requisite** are that any of the NoMachine server products is installed on the remote computer, that you know the IP of that computer and that you have a system account there.

If you want to connect to a computer, you will need to know its IP address. To know the IP address of a specific NoMachine host, open the NoMachine User Interface on that computer, and you will see a 'Welcome' panel like this one:

<figure><img src="https://kb.nomachine.com/images_articles/documents_v8/nm-free-8/welcome_IP_external_free.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you want to connect to this computer over the Internet, write down the external IP address and its port number. In our example: nx://151.1.192.128:29382.

If you are connecting on a local network instead, you just need the private IP, 192.168.2.29 in this case. Port is 4000 by default.

You will need this information when creating the connection to this host from your client device. Follow these quick steps:

Step 1: Go now to the client device from which you want to connect to this host. Install NoMachine, which can make connections as well as accept incoming connections, or NoMachine Enterprise Client.

Step 2: Run NoMachine User Interface (UI) from the programs or applications menu.

Step 3: Click on 'Add' and provide the relevant information: a name for the connection, the IP address and port number of the computer you want to connect to (you made a note of it earlier):

<figure><img src="https://kb.nomachine.com/images_articles/documents_v8/nm-free-8/address.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Step 4: Any available computers on your network, or connections you created appear in the 'Machines' view of the UI. For example, if you just created a connection called 'Testdrive':

<figure><img src="https://kb.nomachine.com/images_articles/documents_v8/nm-free-8/machines_settings.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Launch the connection by double-clicking on its icon. You will be requested to provide the username and password of a valid account for the remote computer.
